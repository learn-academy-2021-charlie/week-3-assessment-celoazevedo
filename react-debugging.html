<!-- ASSESSMENT 3: React Debugging Challenge -->

<!-- This file contains two React components in an HTML file. This React code is broken. Fix the THREE bugs in the code so the user can draw cards and reset the deck. Note: The components are correctly described in this file structure. There is no need to change the architecture of any code. -->

<!-- To see this component, drag the file tab into the browser. -->

<!-- HINT: Check the console in the browser developer tools for errors. The lines numbers may not match up with the line numbers in your text editor. -->
