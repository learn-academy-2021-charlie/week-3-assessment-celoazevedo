# ASSESSMENT 3: Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

2. What is yarn? What file(s) are modified in a React application when you run yarn?

  Your answer: yarn is a package manager much like npm is. When you run yarn in your application it will install all of the dependencies that you might need to develop. It will create a node modules folder where it will store all of the dependencies and it will also create a package.json file that will have all of the dependencies that are being used listed for the app to use.

3. What are props in React?

  Your answer: Oh boy... props allow parent components to pass information to the child components. I am almost incline to say that props allow the child components to access the properties available in the state object and the methods that are part of the parent component. EVERYTHING IS A PROP!

5. What is a DOM event?

  Your answer: a DOM event is all of the information that we get upon some type of interation with the DOM. It could be from a click of the mouse, a click of a button or hoovering over an element. The event object gives us access to a (rediculous) number of objects and properties giving the developer the power to interact with the DOM and send and receive data.
