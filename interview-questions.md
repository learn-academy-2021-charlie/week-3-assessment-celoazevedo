# ASSESSMENT 3: Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.


1. What is `this` in JavaScript?

  Your answer: this is a keyword in js that refers to the properties and methods that are part of the instance of the class. Part of the specific object that is being created.

2. What is yarn? What file(s) are modified in a React application when you run yarn?

  Your answer: yarn is a package manager much like npm is. When you run yarn in your application it will install all of the dependencies that you might need to develop. It will create a node modules folder where it will store all of the dependencies and it will also create a package.json file that will have all of the dependencies that are being used listed for the app to use.

3. What are props in React?

  Your answer: Oh boy... props allow parent components to pass information to the child components. I am almost incline to say that props allow the child components to access the properties available in the state object and the methods that are part of the parent component. EVERYTHING IS A PROP!

4. What is JSX?

  Your answer: JSX is a templating language much like HTML but unlike HTML, it allows us to write javascript withing the elemement's tag. We use the curly braces to escape JSX and enter JS land.

5. What is a DOM event?

  Your answer: a DOM event is all of the information that we get upon some type of interation with the DOM. It could be from a click of the mouse, a click of a button or hoovering over an element. The event object gives us access to a (rediculous) number of objects and properties giving the developer the power to interact with the DOM and send and receive data.

6. STRETCH: What is an anonymous function in JavaScript?

  Your answer: an anonymous function is a function without a name (hehe!). In javascript we tipically use anonymous functions as callback functions.

  () => {}

  function (e) {
    console.log(e)
  }

## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

1. Conditional rendering: in React we can use the conditional operators (if or the ternatry operators) to decide what kind of state a specific element will be in (what values it's properties will have at a specific time) and React will render it if meets the condition.

2. Ruby: is a dynamic programing language. I think that by dinamic they mean that you can declare varibales and reassign them values as you please. Apparently Ruby has an elegant syntax and it is easy to read. I wonder if when they say easy they are just comparing it to JS.

3. Object oriented programming: OOP is a programing paradigm. It is a set of rules that programers agreed upon to keep the code clean, readable (you can easily find what you want in the code), scalable, and prevents major headaches if people need to make changes to the code.

4. Ruby hash: a collection of key value pairs

5. Ruby blocks: I think that this is like a code block. It envelops a chunck of code.
